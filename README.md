# Pointers in C++

 ### Aim
To study and implement the concept of pointers in C++ for efficient memory access and manipulation.

---

 ### Theory
- A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
- Pointers enable dynamic memory management, efficient array handling, and function referencing.
- They support indirect access to variables and are essential for implementing data structures like linked lists and trees.
- Pointer arithmetic allows traversal and manipulation of memory locations.
- Proper use of pointers enhances performance and flexibility in C++ programs.

---

 ### Tool Used
- C++ programming language  
- Standard input/output libraries (`iostream`)  
- Compiler supporting C++11 or later

---

 ### Functions Used
- Declaration and initialization of pointers  
- Dereferencing using `*` operator  
- Address referencing using `&` operator  
- Dynamic memory allocation using `new` and `delete`  
- Pointer arithmetic for array traversal  
- Passing pointers to functions for indirect data manipulation

 ### Algorithm: Arithmetic Operations Using Pointers

1. Start  
2. Declare two integer variables  
3. Declare two integer pointers and assign them the addresses of the variables  
4. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using dereferenced pointers  
5. Display the results  
6. End

---

 ### Algorithm: Array Reversal Using Pointer

1. Start  
2. Declare an array of fixed size  
3. Declare a pointer and assign it to the base address of the array  
4. Use two pointers: one at the start and one at the end of the array  
5. Swap elements pointed by the two pointers  
6. Increment start pointer and decrement end pointer until they meet  
7. Display the reversed array  
8. End

---

 ### Algorithm: Pointer Increment

1. Start  
2. Declare an integer array  
3. Declare a pointer and assign it to the base address of the array  
4. Use a loop to increment the pointer and access each element  
5. Display each element using the pointer  
6. End

---

 ### Algorithm: String Reversal Using Pointer

1. Start  
2. Declare a character array (string)  
3. Declare a pointer and assign it to the base address of the string  
4. Use two pointers: one at the start and one at the end of the string  
5. Swap characters pointed by the two pointers  
6. Increment start pointer and decrement end pointer until they meet  
7. Display the reversed string  
8. End

 ### Conclusion
Pointers are a fundamental feature of C++ that provide direct access to memory and enable powerful programming techniques. They allow developers to manage resources efficiently, implement dynamic data structures, and optimize performance-critical applications. Understanding pointers is essential for low-level programming tasks, such as system programming, embedded development, and memory-sensitive operations. Mastery of pointer concepts also lays the foundation for advanced topics like memory leaks, segmentation faults, and smart pointers in modern C++. By learning how to declare, manipulate, and apply pointers effectively, programmers gain deeper control over program behavior and resource management, making their code more robust, scalable, and adaptable to complex computing environments.
